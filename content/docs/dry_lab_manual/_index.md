# Welcome to the Dry Lab Manual

## Overview

Analagous to the wet lab manual, this dry lab manual will serve as a reference for standard protocols for data processing and analysis in the Cillo Lab. While many computational biologists are independnent thinkers, it is important to have unifying analytical pipelines and approaches to ensure that we are all speaking the same language. I anticipate this will be a living document that will be updated somewhat frequently to keep up with state of the art approaches in computational biology.
