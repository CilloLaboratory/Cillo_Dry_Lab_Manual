A Sunday on La Grande Jatte - 1884

# Seurat

Seurat is an R package developed and maintained by [Rahul Satija's group](https://satijalab.org/) at the New York Genome Center. It has become one of the premier packages for single-cell RNAseq because it:
- Implements data structures for storing expression data and associated metadata
- Faciliates many key steps of single-cell RNAseq analysis
- Provides plotting functionality 
- Methods for more advanced analysis including multi-modal analysis (eg paired scATAC-seq and scRNAseq or paired CITEseq and scRNAseq) and data integration tools to align datasets from different technologies or sources

It takes its name from the painter Georges Seurat, who was a French Neo-Impressionist and pointalist. It's a tongue in cheek reference to the many points that are often on display in tSNEs or UMAPs.
